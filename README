This is a game for the M5Stack Faces Kit which was originally designed for the 
ÂµGame game console, based on the classic Space Invaders arcade game.

It was built using the Stage - Tile and Sprite Library created by dehsipu https://github.com/deshipu

To play, first flash the micropython.bin file to the M5Stack with esptool

Use a tool such as Ampy https://github.com/pycampers/ampy or the M5Stack plugin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9pOWgsNgKk 
for VScode to copy the remaining files to the flash partition of the device.

Run the game by renaming the game.py file to main.py and reset or with the ampy command
(replace port name with /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART for MAC, com port for windows or /dev/ttyUSB0 on linux)

ampy --port "port name" run game.py

The game is a little unstable and doesn't fill the whole screen, I will fix this once I figure out how to.
